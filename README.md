# Data-Persistence-Project
Data Persistence Unity Code Challenge

This project is a challenge from the Unity Learning course. 
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-data-persistence-in-a-new-repo

I'm using the example project.
For sake of finishing project this in time, I'm not using Json file loader, as it always give errors and I couldn't find a solution for this problem.

So I'm using the standard PlayerPrefs save method.

The player can be controlled using Arrow Keys/WASD and Space, or Mouse. Just start using one or another.

The only goal is to score higher. For now it's only local Scoring.

The game has three difficulties - easy, medium and hard - and the harder, the more points you earn.

I hope you have fun and score more than 276 points.
